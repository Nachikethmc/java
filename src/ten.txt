    The rapid evolution of digital technologies has dramatically transformed how computational resources are accessed and utilized. Cloud computing has emerged as a cornerstone of this transformation by offering scalable, on-demand services over the internet, enabling organizations to efficiently process large datasets and deploy applications without the need for substantial infrastructure investments. However, as modern applications increasingly demand ultra-low latency, real-time processing, and enhanced data privacy, the limitations of centralized cloud architectures have become more apparent. Challenges such as high network latency, limited connectivity in remote areas, bandwidth constraints, and data sovereignty concerns hinder the effectiveness of traditional cloud-centric models, especially for Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and mission-critical systems.
